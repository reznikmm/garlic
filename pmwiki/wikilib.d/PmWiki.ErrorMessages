Besides that it is running on windows. FYI: this is the 2.0.beta37 version. I didn't have this%0aproblem with version 1.%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0aQ: I get an warning message (2.0 Beta36) when i use the pagelist-markup. No matter on which page or what parameters i get this:%0a %0aWarning: Wrong parameter count for array_merge() in /home/g/xxx.de/public_html/wiki/scripts/pagelist.php on line 87%0a%0aWarning: Cannot add header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/g/xxx.de/public_html/wiki/scripts/pagelist.php:87) in /home/g/xxx.de/public_html/wiki/pmwiki.php on line 700%0a%0a'''The result is ok, but how can i get rid of that warning ?  '''%0a%0a----%0a%0aQ: I'm getting the following warnings:%0aWarning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/www/dept-of-films/pmwiki/pmwiki.php on line 31%0a%0aWarning: Cannot add header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/www/dept-of-films/pmwiki/pmwiki.php:31) in /home/www/dept-of-films/pmwiki/pmwiki.php on line 704%0a%0aAny ideas on what this means or how to fix?%0a%0aA:%0aFirst warning-- something went wrong in pmwiki.php.  If you can tell us which version, we can trace the line number to the code.  Alternatively, you can try upgrading to the latest version. see [[PmWiki/Installation]] for the current files & upgrade links.  It's possible the bug was already fixed.%0a%0aAlso, double check your config.php file -- maybe something is wrong there which is being processed by pmwiki.php.%0a%0aSecond warning -- this can be ignored in this case -- the 2nd warning was created because the first warning sent output to the browser before pmwiki sent all it's header information to the browser.  Had the first error not happened, the second error wouldn't have.%0a%0a----%0aQ: still have this pb after  ?action=attr %0a%0a'''also I move pmwiki at root ?'''%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]'''Warning: Unknown: open'''[[%3c%3c]]('''/var/www/free.fr/c/0/pm/sessions/sess_0597f2bc9aa5cac005a89f00e4'''[[%3c%3c]]'''0bff8e, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) in Unknown '''[[%3c%3c]]'''on line 0'''%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]'''Warning: Unknown: Failed to write session data (files).

In some hosting environments, you may have no other choice but to chmod 777 (or rwx all if you're using an FTP client) that directory.  %0a%0aAn alternative is to make the Web server the owner of the wiki.d directory, leaving the permissions 'writable by owner only' (e.g. 755 is typically the default).%0a%0aQ: Hi, I seem to be having the same problem:%0a%0a'''Cannot acquire lockfile'''%0a%0aI downloaded and unzipped the Wiki on my server. I set the permissions of the wiki dir to 777 and then I try to run. I see that the script creates a '''wiki.d''' directory: %0a%0adrwxrwxrwx   2 httpd    httpd        4096 Dec 14 02:26 wiki.d%0a%0aBut it seems not to be able to write to it... What could the problem be here?%0a%0a(I'm using PHP Version 4.3.4 and I did get PmWiki 1.0 to run here once before.)%0a%0aA: Okay, I fugured it out.%0a%0aThis problem may happen if SAFE MODE has been turned on in your PHP configuration. In such a case you might find the following message in your error log:%0a%0aPHP Warning:  fopen(): SAFE MODE Restriction in effect.  The script whose uid is XXX is not allowed to access /home/***/public_html/wiki/wiki.d owned by uid YYY%0a%0aA workaround for that problem is to create all the wiki data directories (wiki.d and uploads) by hand and chmod them to 666.%0a%0a@@mkdir wiki.d@@%0a%0a@@mkdir uploads@@%0a%0a@@chmod 666 wiki.d@@%0a%0a@@chmod 666 uploads@@%0a%0a--''postrational''%0a%0aP.S.
