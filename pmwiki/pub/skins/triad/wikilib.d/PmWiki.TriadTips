All other "surrounding" content including action links and buttons can be changed by editing the relevant subpage: See [[Site.Triad-Configuration]] %0a%0a!!!Setting defaults from config.php [[#defaults]]%0aAll the default settings can be changed by setting them in config.php. This allows to have several wikis as part of a farm, using one farm-installed skin, but having different defaults, like color and font schemes. %0a %0a!!!Setting different defaults for colors and fonts%0aYou can set a new default color or font scheme in config.php by setting $DefaultColor = ' ''keyword'' '; or $DefaultFont = ' ''keyword'' '; for instance $DefaultColor = 'gold'; which will load the gold color scheme from the c-gold.css file by default. If you wish that only the default scheme is used then you need to disable the switching of style options (see next section).%0a %0a!!!Switching off all style changing options (disabling cookie setting)[[#disable]]%0aSet in config.php [@$EnableStyleOptions = 0;@]%0aThis disables the cookie setting routines which the style switching relies on by not loading stylechange.php, the script with the cookie setting routines.%0a%0a!!!Switching off selected style changing options%0aSet in config.php [@$EnableColorOptions = 0;@] to switch off color options, or [@$EnableFontOptions = 0;@] to switch off font options. Another way would be in skin.php to place comment #-symbols in front of all array items of the $Page...List arrays which are not required. But make sure that the default set with $DefaultColor, $DefaultFont etc is available.%0a%0a!!!Restricting style options %0aIn skin.php place #-comment symbols at the beginning of each option in the $Page..List option array which should be disallowed. Leave only the options uncommented which are allowed.%0a%0a!!!Adding more color (or font) options [[#adding]]%0aBest is to save a colour (font) css file under a new name, add a line to the $PageColorList ($PageFontList) array, like [@'newcolor' => 'c-newcolor.css'; @] , add the new option as a link to a wiki page like [[Site/TriadStyleOptions]] to create a switch to set the new colour scheme, and then edit the css file, changing colours and background images etc till it is right.%0a%0a!!!Setting different default color schemes for different groups [[#groupdefaults]]%0aThis makes most sense if the colour changing option is disabled. See above the first two entries for this. If it is not disabled users will see the colours they have choosen last (unless they have not yet choosen a different colour scheme).\\%0aDeclare a default colour in config.php as the site's default, like adding [@$DefaultColor = 'blue';@], and declaring default colours for specific groups in a group.php file. If it does not exist create one in the local directory, like [@local/MyGroup.php@] with content for example like:%0a [=%0a     %3c?php if (!defined('PmWiki')) exit();%0a     $DefaultColor = 'gold';%0a     ?>%0a=]%0aLikewise defaults for other style options like fonts and layout can be set in config.php or group.php files.%0a%0a!!!Using [@(:theme ...:)@] markup to display colour and font schemes [[#theme]]%0aA custom markup [@(:theme colourscheme fontscheme:)@] can be used to show individual pages or groups with different colour and font schemes. For instance [@(:theme gold:)@] will show the current page in 'gold' colour scheme. [@(:theme gold georgia:)@] will show the current page in 'gold' colour scheme and %0a'georgia' font scheme. The first parameter after [@(:theme@] needs to be a valid colour scheme name, the second parameter is optional and needs to be a valid font scheme name (or be omitted).\\%0aTheme markup can be disabled by setting $EnableThemes = 0; in skin.php.%0a%0a!!!Showing a `RightBar page on all pages as default [[#rightbr]]%0aSet [@$EnableRightBar = 1;@] in skin.php or config.php. Authors can still disable the `RightBar on individual pages or groups using custom markup [@(:noright:)@].%0aLikewise if the `RightBar is not shown as default, then authors can show it on individual pages or groups using custom markup [@(:showright:)@] on the page or the `GroupHeader page.%0a%0a!!!Disabling [@(:showright:)@] markup %0aSetting [@$EnableMarkupShowRight = 0;@] will disable the [@(:showright:)@] markup.%0a%0a!!!Showing an empty right column if no `RightBar is present%0aBy default no empty column is shown and the content will stretch all the way to the right. But setting [@$EnableEmptyRightBar = 1;@] will show an empty column even if no `RightBar is present.%0a%0a!!!Creating special `RightBar content boxes [[#boxes]]%0aBy creating division sections with [@>>clip%3c%3c@]] ...section text... [@>>%3c%3c@] the text will appear in a specially styled box.%0a(:markup:) [@%0a>>clip%3c%3c%0acontent box specially styled for `RightBar.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a@] %0a%0a!!!Creating styled boxes for quotations %0aEnclose your quotation with [@>>bquote%3c%3c@] ...quotation... [@>>%3c%3c@]]. Use [@%25qsource%25@] for the quote source reference. Leave an empty line before closing the div:%0a(:markup:) [@%0a>>bquote%3c%3c%0aThis is a  quotation....%0a%25qsource%25&mdash; anonymous%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a@]%0a%0a!!!Creating styled right floated boxes%0aEnclose content to be right floated in a 200px wide box with [@>>news%3c%3c@] ...right floated content... [@>>%3c%3c@]%0a(:markup:) [@%0a>>news%3c%3c%0aright floated content%0a>>%3c%3c%0anormal content%0a@]%0a%0a!!!Creating styled boxes for `SideBar content%0aEnclose your special sidebar text content with [@>>sideclip%3c%3c@] ...sidebar text... [@>>%3c%3c@]%0a%0a!!!Removing or relocating the searchbox and the fontsizer buttons [[#search]]%0aBy default the searchbox and fontsizer are included as markup in the [[Site.PageHeader]] page. Edit the page to change this. You can relocate them to other page configuration pages, like the `SideBar. Setting [@$EnableFontSizer = 0;@] will disable the fontsizing option and remove the sizer buttons. Setting %0a[@$EnableViewSwitcher = 0;@] will disable the switching of normal to big text view.%0a%0a!!!Disabling Hide/Show buttons for right and left side column [[#hideshow]]%0aSet [@$EnableRightBarToggle = 0;@] and/or [@$EnableLeftBarToggle = 0;@] to disable the instant side column toggles.%0a%0a!!!Adding a logo and/or site title [[#headr]]%0aA logo can be added to the [[Site.PageHeader]] page. %0a%0a!!!Changing the title display [[#titlebr]]%0aTriad now (2007-03-19) has a separate page to configure the titlebar: [[Site.TitleBar]]. Editing the contents of that page can give you different titlebar layouts. GroupName.TitleBar is also supported for group-specific titlebar settings. A page specific titlebar can also be created (see below). - The default Site.TitleBar page uses pagegroup and pagetitle style classes for the grouplink and title, which are defined in layout-triad.css and further in the color css files. You could create your own style classes for further customisations.%0a%0a!!!Removing the group name from the titlebar %0aYou can remove the group link in the titlebar on individual pages (or groups) with markup [@(:nogroup:)@]. %0aChanging [@$EnableGroupTitle = 1;@] to [@$EnableGroupTitle = 0;@] in skin.php removes the group name from the titlebar for the whole site. You can also edit [[Site.TitleBar]] and remove the grouplink markup there. %0a%0aA nice alternative for showing the group name in the titlebar is showing it as a link in the PageTopMenu. Add [@*[[{*$Group}]]@] to the list will do the trick. Adding [@*[[{*$Name}]]@] will show the page name as well, which may be useful information, since the page title may be different from the actual page name.%0a%0a!!!Creating page titles with non-standard (fancy) fonts%0aThe normal page titles can be replaced with images of non-standard (fancy) fonts, by creating a page%0awith the string "-`TitleBar" added to the name of the page, like "`MyPage-`TitleBar". Put the image as %0aattachment on this page, without any lines before or after (for instance: [@Attach:myfancyfonttitle.gif@]).%0aBest is to create a gif image of the title in special font, using a transparent background, in  %0aan image editor. A page named as described above will take the place of the normal page title, %0ain the space of the titlebar. (''from fixflow-v3e and gemini-v9e onwards'')%0a%0a!!!Support for Cluster and Hg recipes [[#cluster]]%0aTriad now (2007-03-19) has built-in support for [[Cookbook:Cluster]] and [[Cookbook:Hg]], for easy display of a "breadcrumb trail" of group links in the titlebar. You may need to edit [[Site.TitleBar]] to put in the relevant breadcrumb markup (Cluster's breadcrumb PV is provided in the default).%0a%0a!!!Using the Popup-`EditForm [[#editform]]%0aPopup-`EditForm is the default edit form and provides popup preview and help panes, as well as a wide edit window and double rows of buttons both abopve and below the edit textbox. If it is not wanted it can be disabled by commenting out in skin.php the line [@include_once("$SkinDir/popup2edit.php");@]. If the use of toggle buttons is not needed the line [@include_once("$SkinDir/showhide.php");@] can also be commented out, which prevents these scripts from loading. If any of these scripts are loaded as a cookbook script then the corresponding code lines should also be commented out.%0a%0a!!!Using Toggle Buttons [[#togglebuttons]]%0aThe included showhide.php script adds the popup preview and help functionality. The markup [@(:showhide div=divname ... :)@] can also be used on any other page to create toggle buttons to toggle whatever section or object. See [[(Cookbook:)ShowHide]] for details.%0a%0a%0a
