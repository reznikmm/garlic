History for the DropDownSkin for PmWiki 2.x:
============================================
* 14-Mar-2005 link #Topp didn'T work with IE - fixed (#!*& IE)

* 10-Mar-2005 Another attempt to fix the display problem of edit links

* 04-Mar-2005 Fixed problem with display of edit links, when e.g (:noheader:) is used

* 28-Feb-2005 Added Editlinks for GroupHeader and GroupFooter. Both can also be disabled

* 24-Feb-2005 Updated for PmWiki2.0beta22

* 28-Jan-2005 Updated csshover.htc to newset version, minor design updates, 
  fixed minor SideBar menu display in IE

* 26-Jan-2005 NEW: Possibility to edit the  bottom link bar (BottomBar).
  Added variable $DropDownSkin['BottomBarEdit'] for hiding the edit link for
  the BottomBar. Added also support for loading files according to $DefaultGroup
  (e.g. $DefaultGroup.SideBar). Fixed some missing handling of links depending on
  $EnablePathInfo

* 21-Jan-2005 Added variable $DropDownSkin['PageLeftFmt'],
  $DropDownSkin['PageFooterFmt'], $DropDownSkin['PageHeaderFmt'],
  $DropDownSkin['PageTitleFmt'], $DropDownSkin['PageMenuFmt']
  for hiding the according areas on every wikpage. Fixed loading of styles for
  print preview (should not be loaded). Added wiwki-markups (:noleft:) and
  (:nomenu:)

* 19-Jan-2005 Addded variable "$DropDownSkin['SideBarEdit']" and 
  "$DropDownSkin['MenuBarEdit']" which allow removing the edit links for the
  MenuBar or SideBar indiviually. When a (:noleft:) directive (see readme.txt)
  is used the width of the main display area is changed accordingly. Added
  variable "$DropDownSkin['LeftSearch']" which allows removing the searchbox
  within the PageLeftFmt. Added CSS code for handling (:searchbox:) in the
  MenuBar and SideBar. Fixed some minor display problems that resulted in
  different display on IE and FireFox.

* 17-Jan-2005 NEW: Selectable Versions of the skin depending on setting of 
  "$DropDownSkin['Version']" in your config.php. Value "0" is kind of a 
  compatibility mode, i.e. everything stays the same as before ths version.
  Value "1" gives 4 menulevels (main and 3 sublevels), which could be easliy
  extended just by changing the .CSS file. For this version you need to enter
  "----" in the wiki-markup to separate the main menu items. For menuitems that
  are not links you have to add %menuitem% before. Value "2" uses bascially the
  same restrictions or extensions like "1" but allows also to use drop down
  menus in the SideBar. Value "3" allows usage of drop down menus only in the
  SideBar (intended for lower usage of bandwidth, when you use no MenuBar).
  Values greater than "0" allow also the usage of an almost line within the list
  which has the function and will look like a separator. (see readme.txt) I used
  an array ($DropDownSkin[]) for easily adding additonal variables for future
  enhancements/extensions. For additional compatibility I switched to numbered
  lists in the menus. Added possibility to translate "MenuBar" and "SideBar" in
  your local XLPage. Now automatic change of the edit-URL for MenuBar and
  EditBar is integrated depending on the setting of "$EnablePathInfo"

* 13-Jan-2005 Removed extra </td> which I forgot in the .tmpl file. Found a problem
  in the dropdown.php file. There were some variables missing in the MenuBar and 
  SideBar display function. fixed with this release.

* 11-Jan-2005 NEW: When the directive "(:noheader:)" is used the editlinks for 
  SideBar and MenuBar in the footer also disappear.

* 07-Jan-2005 I had to change the "overflow" parameter in the .CSS file again as 
  these scrollbars also occured when a page with embedded graphics is shown (in 
  FireFox). Reloading fixed it. It looks like FirFox thinks the page is bigger as 
  it should be because the picture is loaded afterwards. Now it should work again.

* 06-Jan-2005 The .CSS file needed rework as a display problem occured with Firefox 
  (Thanks Pm for pointing on that one), when a MenuBar is used. I don't know why but 
  defining some margins on all four sides instead only on one side helped (in 
  #menubar). Now everything should be OK. If you find any problems, please report.

* 05-Jan-2005 I changed again the .CSS and the .TMPL file. The hack I did earlier 
  introduced another problem with IE. The problem was that the right side of the 
  layout (DIV) didn't took up the available space in IE, when the content (e.g. 
  table) only needed e.g. 80%. Firefox worked already. Now when the browser window 
  get too small for displaying all the content scroll bars are shown (similar to 
  frameset). Thanks to Paul for pointing me onto this problem. I uploaded the new 
  files. I also found an error in the Javascript within the .TMPL file when no 
  MenuBar is used. IE should now show no error on the page anymore.

* 17-Dec-2004 Fixed a floating problem with IE (a hack was necessary). I uploaded 
  the fixed version :). I hope Pm will update the files on his server, to show 
  the proper functionality.

* 16-Dec-2004 I'm currently working on some minor design (mainly colors) issues. 
  First Release
