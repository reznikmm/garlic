# Introduction to GLADE

An Ada 95 distributed application comprises a number of partitions which can
be executed concurrently on the same machine or, and this is the interesting
part, can be distributed on a network of machines. The way in which partitions
communicate is described in Annex E of the Ada 95 reference manual.

A partition is a set of compilation units that are linked together to produce
an executable binary. A distributed program comprises two or more communicating
partitions.

The tool `gnatdist` and its configuration language allows the user to partition
his program and to specify the machines on which the individual partitions are
to execute.

`gnatdist` reads a configuration file (whose syntax is described in section
[The Configuration Language](https://github.com/reznikmm/garlic/blob/master/Doc/glade_ug.md#The-Configuration-Language))
and builds several executables, one for each partition. It also takes care
of launching the different partitions with parameters that can
be specific to each partition.
