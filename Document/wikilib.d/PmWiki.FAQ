text=(:title Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):)%0a%0aThis page tries to answer the more common questions you might want answered.%0aMany of the answers refer you to other pages for details.%0a%0aFor frequently requested features, see the [[(PITS:)PITS]] pages.%0a%0a%0a>>faq%3c%3c%0a%0aQ: How do I get my question answered?%0aA: The quickest and best way is to join the pmwiki-users [[Mailing List(s)]] and post your question there. If it really is a frequently-asked question, it will eventually be added to this page.%0a%0aAn alternative way is to leave your question on the [[(PmWiki:)Questions]] page.%0a%0a%0aQ: What does warning message or error message "xxxxx" mean?%0aA: Error/warning questions and answers are on the [[Error Messages]] page.%0a%0a%0aQ: How and why do I use the [[Site/EditForm]] feature?%0aA: This feature allows an admin to customize PmWiki's edit window. It is  active by default in PmWiki version 2 beta 44 or later. Some [[Cookbook:Skins]] customize the $PageEditFmt variable which overrides the edit form, making it inoperative.%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I use passwd-formatted files (like .htpasswd) for authentication?%0aA: See [[Cookbook:AuthUser]] and [[Cookbook:UserAuth]]%0a%0a%0aQ: Where can I get help with PmWiki? (This is a pretty vague question!)%0aA: See this FAQ, [[Troubleshooting]], [[Error Messages]], or try a [[Site/Search]].%0a%0a%0aQ: I'm getting a lot of spam on my wiki site.  How can I password protect the pages?%0aA: See [[PmWiki.Security]]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I create nice tables similar to Product X?  %0aA: See [[simple tables]] and [[advanced tables]]. %0a%0a%0aQ: Why are '`RecentChanges', '`AllRecentChanges', '`RecentUploads', '`AllRecentUploads' editable?%0aA: You might want to edit these pages if a spammer creates a page with an unsavory name. To prevent others from editing these pages, insert the following lines into your ''local/config.php'' file. Editing then requires the admin password.%0a%0a[@%0a## Require admin password to edit RecentChanges (etc.) pages.%0aif ($action=='edit'%0a  && preg_match('/\\.(All)?Recent(Changes|Uploads)$/',%0a  $pagename)) { $DefaultPasswords['edit'] = '*'; }%0a@]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I include special characters on my wiki pages?%0aA: Use character codes to insert special characters, such as Copyright (&#169;) and Trademark (&#174; or &#8482;) symbols, that don't appear on your keyboard.%0a%0a%0aQ: Is it possible to move wiki.d to /tmp/persistent/wiki.d (a new sourceforge rule)?%0aA: Sourceforge suggest moving everything to /tmp/persistent/new-folder-of-your-choice and creating a soft link to the new folder on /tmp . It works. See [[Cookbook:SourceForgeServers]]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I set one Header for all pages/groups?%0aA: Add the following to config.php%0a [=%0a$GroupHeaderFmt .= "Wikicode or text here";=]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I insert RSS news feeds in PmWiki?%0aA: See [[Cookbook:RssFeedDisplay]].%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I change the Wiki's default name in the upper left corner of the Main Page.%0aA: Put the following config.php%0a%0a    [@$WikiTitle = 'My Wiki Site';@]%0a%0aThis appears in the sample-config.php file in the PmWiki distribution.  Copy sample-config.php as "config.php" in your local/ directory and edit it.%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I customize the CSS styling of my PmWiki layout?[[#customcss]]%0aA: See [[Skins]] for how to change the default PmWiki skin.  See also [[Cookbook:Skins]], where you will find pre-made templates you can use to customize the appearance of your site.  You can also create a file called local.css in the pub/css/ directory and add CSS selectors there (this file gets automatically loaded if it exists), or add them in your local ''local/config.php'' file by inserting something similar to:%0a%0a    [@$HTMLStylesFmt[] = '%0a      .foo { color:blue; }';@]%0a%0aQ: How do I insert pictures on wiki pages?%0aA: See [[PmWiki/Images]].%0a%0aQ: How do I link to an uploaded file from another group?%0aA: Use [@Attach:Groupname/filename.ext@]%0a%0aQ: Is it possible to link an image on PmWiki without using a fully qualified URL?%0aA: Yes. The general format is [@Attach:Group.PageName/filename.ext@].%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I change the font or background color of the hints block on the Edit Page?%0aA: Add a CSS style to pub/css/local.css: [@.quickref {background:...; color:... }@]. The hints are provided by the [[Site.EditQuickReference]] page, which is in the PmWiki or Site wikigroup.  Edit that page, and change the "bgcolor" or specify the font "color" to get the contrast you need.%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I make pmwiki.php the default page for a website?  Should I rename pmwiki.php to index.php?%0aA: Renaming pmwiki.php is not recommended. Instead, create an ''index.php'' file that contains the single line:%0a [=%0a%3c?php include_once('pmwiki.php');=]%0a%0aYou may also want to check [[Cookbook:CleanUrls]].%0a%0a%0aQ: When I upload a file, how do I make the link look like "file.doc" instead of "Attach:file.doc"?%0aA: Use parentheses, as in [@[[(Attach:)file.doc]]@].  You can make a configuration change that eliminates the [@Attach:@] -- see [[Cookbook:AttachLinks]].%0a%0a%0aQ: There seems to be a default password.  What is it? [[#pwlocked]]%0aA: There isn't any valid password until you set one.  See [[PasswordsAdmin]] for how to set an admin password.%0a%0aPmWiki comes "out of the box" with%0a$DefaultPasswords['admin'] set to '*'.   This doesn't mean the password%0ais an asterisk, it means that default admin password has to be%0asomething that encrypts to an asterisk.  Since it's impossible for the%0acrypt() function to ever return a 1-character encrypted value, the admin%0apassword is effectively locked until the admin sets one in config.php.%0a%0a%0aQ: How can I embed PmWiki pages inside a web page?%0aA: Source them through a PHP page, or place them in a frame.%0a%0a%0aQ: Why does pmwiki.org appear to have a directory structure rather than "?n=pagename" in [=URLs=]?%0aA: Pmwiki.org uses a variant of [[Cookbook:CleanUrls]].%0a%0a%0aQ: Can I remove items from the wikilib.d folder on my site?%0aA: Yes, the files in ''wikilib.d/'' can be safely removed.  They'll reappear again when you upgrade, however.  If you want to permanently configure your site so that these distribution pages don't appear, try:%0a%0a    [@$WikiLibDirs = array(&$WikiDir);@]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I exclude wiki-related pages from searches?%0aTry the following in your ''local/config.php file''.  See also [[Cookbook:SearchPatterns]].%0a%0a[@%0a## Exclude Certain pages / groups from search results.%0a$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!\\.(All)?Recent(Changes|Uploads)$!';%0a$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!\\.Group(Print)?Header$!';%0a$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!^Site\\.!';%0a$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!^PmWiki\\.!';%0a@]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I put a link that will open as a new window?%0aA: Use the [@%25newwin%25@] wikistyle, as in:%0a(:markup:) [=%25newwin%25http://www.example.com/=]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I place a mailing address in a page?%0aA: Use the [@mailto:@] markup, as in%0a(:markup:) [=[[mailto:myaddress@example.com]]=]%0aor%0a(:markup:) [=[[mailto:myaddress@example.com | myaddress@example.com]]=]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I make a WikiWord link to an external page instead of a WikiPage?%0aA: Use link markup.  There are two formats:%0a(:markup:) [=[[http://www.example.com/ | WikiWord]]=]%0aor%0a(:markup:) [=[[WikiWord -> http://www.example.com/]]=]%0a%0aQ: How do I find all of the pages that link to another page (i.e., backlinks)?%0aA: Use the [@(:pagelist:)@] command, as in%0a%0a    [@(:pagelist link=SomePage:)   -- show all links to SomePage%0a    (:pagelist link={$FullName}:)  -- show all links to the current page@]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I customize my own 404 error page for non-existent pages?%0aA: Set the following variable%0a%0a    [@$DefaultPageTextFmt = '(:include Site.PageNotFound:)';@]%0a%0aand then edit the '`Site.PageNotFound' page to provide whatever%0amessage you want for non-existent pages.%0a%0a
