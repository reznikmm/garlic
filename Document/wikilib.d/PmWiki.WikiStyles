text=->%green%[[!DocumentationToDo]]: Shorten description about block, item, list. Move perhaps some examples into WikiStyleExamples.께WikiStyles allow an author to modify the color and other attributes of text that follow.  A style specification such as @@[=%red%=]@@ will cause the following text to be displayed as red until the end of the line or the next pair @@[=%%=]@@ of percent signs.  For example:께   [=%red%=] This text is red and [=%blue%=] this text is blue [=%%=] but    this text is normal.께gives께->%red% This text is red and %blue% this text is blue %% but this text is normal.께The set of [[CustomWikiStyles| predefined wiki styles]] is customizable by the WikiAdministrator.  Most PmWiki systems define [=%newwin%=] to cause links to open in a new window (%newwin%[[WikiStyles |example]]), and standard text colors such as [=%black%, %white%, %red%, %green%, %blue%, etc.=]께!!Creating new styles께Placing @@color@@, @@bgcolor@@, or @@target@@ specifications inside of a pair of percent signs will change the style of the following text to use those colors up to the end of a line or until the next pair of percent-signs.  For example:께    [=%color=red% This text is red and %color=blue% this text     is blue %% but this text is normal. =]께renders as께->%color=red% This text is red and %color=blue% this text is blue %% but this text is normal.께If one wants the formatting to continue past the end of the line, there are a couple options one can use (found [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wiki.pmwiki.user/7415|here]]).께For example, using [=%block color=red%=] will continue the formatting until it gets to to the end of the current block/paragraph.  For example:께(:markup:)[=쾆his is some text %block color=red% that쾖s being colored red by the wikistyle in the line.=]께The other options (according to the [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wiki.pmwiki.user/7415 | e-mail]]) are:\\[=%item color=red%=]\\[=%list color=red%=]\\[=%block color=red%=]께!!!!A brief explanation of the difference between item, list, and block Apply=block applies to any sort of block markup, such as쾝aragraphs, lists, indents, and list items.  Apply=list applies to an쾒ntire list -- i.e., anything that generates a <dl>, <ol>, or <ul> tag.콭pply=item applies only to an individual list item (<li>, <dd>, <dt>).께So given the markup께(:markup:)[=   * %apply=XXX border='1px solid black'% First   * second   * third =]께if XXX is 'item' (as in 'apply=item'), then only the first bullet item쾥ill have a box around it.  If XXX is 'list', then the entire bullet쾙ist will be placed in a box.  And if XXX is 'block', then the bullet쾙ist will be placed in a box, as well as the first list item (because'block' covers both).께One can also change the background color using the @@bgcolor@@ attribute:께    [=%color=black bgcolor=green% This text is black on green     %color=green bgcolor=black% and this is green on black.%% =]께%color=black bgcolor=green% This text is black on green %color=green bgcolor=black% and this is green on black.%% 께One can specify that links should open in a new window via the @@target@@ attribute:께    [=%target=_blank% Any links on this line like http://www.pmichaud.com     will open in a new window. =]께which gives께->%target=_blank% Any links on this line like http://www.pmichaud.com will open in a new window.께Finally, WikiStyles can control the width and height of ImagesInWikiPages, thus the markup께    [=%height=50% http://www.example.com/some.gif=]께will display some.gif scaled to a height of 50 pixels.께!!Style definitions%define=hotpink color=#ff69b4%%define=reverse color=white bgcolor=black%께Wiki authors can also make their own [[WikiStyle(s)]] definitions within a document using the @@define@@ attribute.  For example, the statement께    [=%define=hotpink color=#ff69b4%=]께will cause the markup @@[=%hotpink%=]@@ to be a shortcut for @@[=%color=#ff69b4%=]@@ (%hotpink%like this%%).  One can specify multiple items in a definition, as in께    [=%define=reverse color=white bgcolor=black%=]께which allows @@[=%reverse%=]@@ to cause %reverse%reverse video%%, and @@[=%reverse hotpink%=]@@ to be the %reverse hotpink%combination of both shortcuts%%.  께It's often a good idea to put common style definitions into GroupHeaders so that they can be shared among multiple pages in a group.  Or, the WikiAdministrator can predefine styles as a [[LocalCustomization(s)]] -- see CustomWikiStyles.께!!Predefined and custom styles께See [[Custom Wiki Styles]] for a description of the WikiStyles that are predefined in a standard installation of PmWiki. That page also describes how an administrator can predefine additional WikiStyles.께!!Colors콵or some examples of colors, see WikiStyleColors께%trail% <<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>께
