text=One of the purposes of [[WikiGroup]]s is to allow a [[Wiki Administrator]] to customize the features of PmWiki on a per-group basis.  Here is where ''per group customizations'' come into play.께The ''local/'' subdirectory (in the same directory that holds ''pmwiki.php'') is used to hold local configuration files.  To perform [[local customizations]] for a particular WikiGroup, place the customizations in a file called "''Group.php''" (where ''Group'' is the actual name of the page group in question) in the ''local/'' subdirectory.  This file will be automatically processed after processing any local customizations in the ''config.php'' file.께For example, to change the image displayed in the upper-left corner of pages in the "Chess" [[Wiki Group]], one could create ''local/Chess.php'' containing께    <?php      $PageLogoUrl = "/myimages/chess.gif";께This would cause all pages in the Chess [[Wiki Group]] to use "/myimages/chess.gif" as the logo image instead of the default.께Almost any customization that would be placed in ''config.php'' can be used as a per-group customization.께[[#PerPage]] PmWiki also allows per-page customizations, simply use the full name of the page to be customized instead of the group.  For example, one can use the file ''local/Chess.`HomePage.php'' to set local customizations for Chess.`HomePage.께For all local customizations, PmWiki first processes the ''local/config.php'' file, and then looks for a per-page customization file in the ''local/'' subdirectory to process, followed by any per-group customization file.  If no per-page or per-group customizations are loaded, then PmWiki loads ''local/default.php''.께Any customization file can set $EnablePGCust=0; to prevent later page/group/default customizations from being automatically loaded.  If a per-page customization needs to have the per-group customizations loaded first, it can do so directly by using PHP's [@include_once()@] function.께Any passwords required for a group should be set in the group's `GroupAttributes page (see [[PasswordsAdmin]]) and not in a group customization file. 께[[Wiki Group]]s are an easy way to host multple sites in a single PmWiki installation by giving each site its own group.  Another approach is to use [[Wiki Farms]], which allows each site to have its own set of [[Wiki Groups]] and local customization files.  However, if you're hoping to add several levels of groups, [[PmWiki:HierarchicalGroups|read this first]].께%trail% <<|[[DocumentationIndex]]|>>
