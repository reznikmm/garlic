text=Here  are some '''quick '''instructions on how to [[download]] and install [[PmWiki]] 2.0. (There are separate instructions for [[upgrad(es)]]ing.)  See the [[requirements]] page for software needed to run PmWiki. Improvements to these instructions would be greatly appreciated.  Just report any problems you encounter to the pmwiki-users [[mailing list(s)]] or use the [[PITS:PITS |PmWiki Issue Tracking System]].께1. Download the latest version of [[PmWiki]] from http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/ , or get the [[http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/pmwiki-latest.zip | zip archive]] or [[http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/pmwiki-latest.tgz | tgz tarball]] directly (check the ChangeLog to see what new features and bugfixes are available).께2. Unpack the archive ([@tar xvzf pmwiki-x.y.z@]).  This will create a [@pmwiki-x.y.z@] directory which contains the PmWiki software.  The files in this directory include:께    COPYING            The GNU General Public License    local/             A directory for local configuration scripts    pmwiki.php         Main PmWiki script    pub/               Directory of publicly accessible files      css/             Directory for generic .css files      skins/           Directory of [[LayoutBasics |layout templates]]    sample-config.php  A sample configuration file    scripts/           Some scripts that extend the possibilities of PmWiki    wikilib.d/         Directory containing some default PmWiki files    cookbook/          A directory for recipes obtained from the [[(Cookbook:)Cookbook]].께3. The [@pmwiki-x.y.z@] directory needs to be placed into a location accessible by your webserver (e.g., in a ''public_html'' directory of some sort).  You can place files and directories using a number of methods -- FTP, or a Unix [@mv@] or [@cp@] command generally does the job.께->%note% Note: It's probably also a good idea to change the "[@pmwiki-x.y.z@]" directory name to be simply "[@pmwiki@]". 께4. Open a web browser to the ''pmwiki.php'' script on the server (i.e., not the one on your local computer or accessed using a [=file://...=] URL).  PmWiki will then analyze your system configuration and provide instructions (if needed) for creating the ''wiki.d/'' directory which will be used to hold the pages created for your site.  Usually there are two ways to achieve this:께->4a. You can create the ''wiki.d/'' directory manually, and then give it full write permissions (i.e., "[@chmod 777 wiki.d@]")께->4b. On some systems you can let PmWiki create ''wiki.d/'' by temporarily changing the permissions on the directory containing the ''pmwiki.php'' file to 2777.  In Unix this is commonly done by changing to the directory containing ''pmwiki.php'' and executing the command께        chmod 2777 .께->(note the dot at the end). The [@chmod@] command also works in many FTP programs. Creating ''wiki.d/'' in this manner will (1) make the directory writable so the web server can create the data directory it needs for the wiki files, (2) preserve group ownership of the directory so the installer account can manipulate the files created in this directory, and (3) make it more difficult for other accounts on the same server to access the files in ''wiki.d/''.께5.  After establishing directory permissions, try opening a browser to the ''pmwiki.php'' script again.  If all is well, the ''wiki.d'' directory will have been created and you'll see the default home page. \\\콹f you used method 4b, you should reset permissions by executing "[@chmod 755 .@]" in the directory containing pmwiki.php.께6.  Check out [[Initial Setup Tasks]] for other tasks you may want to perform to begin customizing your PmWiki installation.  You might also want to peruse the [[Release Notes]] for further information.께!!!!Notes께* If using the Unix ''tar'' command to unpack the archive in step 2 above, be sure that the files are created with sufficient permissions for the webserver to be able to access them.  Usually you can ensure this by typing @@umask 002@@ on the command line before unpacking the tar file.께%trail%<<|[[PmWiki.Documentation Index]]|>>께Note: this method has not been tried.
