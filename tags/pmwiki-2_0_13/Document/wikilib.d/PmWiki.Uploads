text=%25audience%25 authors (intermediate)%0a%0a''Note: [[PmWiki]] is distributed with uploads disabled by default.  See [[Uploads Admin]] for information about how to enable and configure the upload feature.''%0a%0a!!![@Attach:@] Syntax%0a[[PmWiki]] can be configured to allow authors to upload and attach files to pages.  Each [[Wiki Group]] can have its own collection of named attachments that are shared among all pages in the group.  To add or link to an attachment, an author edits a page to include the markup "@@Attach:@@" followed by a name of an attachment (e.g., "@@[=Attach:resume.pdf=]@@").  When the page is displayed, the @@Attach:@@ markup becomes one of the following:%0a* A link to the named attachment%0a* A link to a form whereby the author can specify a file to be uploaded and used as the new attachment%0a* An [[image(s)]] %0a** If the attachment is an image file such as a .gif or .jpeg - %0a** Image files can be shown as links rather than as images by using the [[Links| link format]], i.e.: [@[[Attach:myphoto.jpg]]@])%0a%0aTo have a link to an attachment appear without the "[@Attach:@]" at the beginning of the link, use [@[[(Attach:)file.ext]]@].%0a%0aTo link to attachments on another page or [[WikiGroup(s)]], use [@Attach:PageName/file.ext@] or [@Attach:Group.PageName/file.ext@]%0a%0a!!!Listing All Files For A Page%0aTo list all files that have been uploaded to the current page, enter the markup:%0a[@(:attachlist:)@]%0a%0aThis will list all files, file size and a link to download the file on the page.%0a%0a!!!Upload Form / Upload Replacement%0aOne can go directly to the upload form by appending "?action=upload" to the URI for any page that has file uploads enabled by the [[Wiki Administrator]]. Replace a file by simply uploading a new version of the file with the same name. Be sure to clear your browser cache after replacing an upload. Otherwise, it may appear that the original upload is still on the server.%0a%0a!!!Type and Size Restrictions%0aFor security reasons, the upload feature is disabled when PmWiki is first installed; once enabled, uploads are generally restricted as to the types and sizes of files that may be uploaded to the server (see UploadsAdmin).  PmWiki's default configuration limits file sizes to 50 kilobytes and file extensions to common types such as ".gif", ".jpg", ".doc", ".txt", and ".pdf".  In addition, the administrator can configure the system to require an @@upload@@ password--see [[Passwords]] and [[PasswordsAdmin]].%0a%0aBy default the upload allows the following extensions:%0a   %0a   [@'gif','jpg','jpeg','png','bmp','ico','wbmp',          # images%0a   'mp3','au','wav',                                     # audio%0a   'mpg','mpeg','wmf','mov','qt','avi',                  # video%0a   'zip','gz','tgz','tar','rpm','hqx',                   # archives%0a   'doc','ppt','xls','exe','mdb',                        # MSOffice%0a   'pdf','psd','ps','ai','eps',                          # Adobe%0a   'htm','html','fla','swf',                             # web stuff%0a   'txt','rtf','exe','tex','dvi',''                      # misc@]%0a%0a!!!Removal%0aAt present uploaded files can only be deleted from the server by the [[wiki administrator]]. Any uploads-authorized user may over-write an existing file by uploading another of the same name and extension to the same location.%0a%0a%25trail%25%3c%3c|[[DocumentationIndex]]|>>
