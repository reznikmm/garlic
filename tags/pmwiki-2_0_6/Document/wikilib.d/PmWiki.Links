text=A key feature of [[WikiWikiWeb]]s is the ease of creating links to other places in the text of the document.  PmWiki provides multiple mechanisms for creating such links.%0a%0a!!Links to other pages%0a%0aTo create a link to another page, simply enclose the name of the page inside double brackets, as in [@[[wiki sandbox]]@] or [@[[installation]]@].  These result in links to [[wiki sandbox]] and [[installation]], respectively.%0a%0aPmWiki ignores all spaces between words when creating a link from the text inside the double brackets, and will automatically capitalize words following spaces and other punctuation (like ~). Thus [@[[Wiki sandbox]]@], [@[[wiki sandbox]]@], and [@[[WikiSandbox]]@] all display differently but link to the same page titled ''`WikiSandbox''.%0a%0aIn other words, when a page is created PmWiki will automatically name the page using title case, but links to the page will display as written.%0a%0aA suffix can also be added to the end of a link, which becomes part of the link text but not the target.  Thus [@[[wiki sandbox]]es@] is a link to WikiSandbox but displays as [[wiki sandbox]]es.  And you can put parentheses around any text you don't want to have displayed, so that [@[[(wiki) sandbox]]@] links to WikiSandbox and displays as [[(wiki) sandbox]].%0a%0aFinally, you can specify the link text via a vertical brace, thus  [@[[WikiSandbox | a play area]]@], which links to WikiSandbox but displays as [[WikiSandbox | a play area]].  You can use an arrow ([@->@]) to reverse the order of the text and target, as in [@[[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]@]  ([[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]).%0a%0aSome sites also recognize [[WikiWord]] links, in which a WikiWord appearing in the text is automatically treated as a link to a page of the same name.%0a%0a!!Links to specific locations within a page%0a%0aTo define a location within a page to which you may jump directly, use the markup [@[[#name]]@].   This creates an "anchor" that uniquely identifies that location in the page.  Then to have a link jump directly to that anchor, use one of%0a%0a* [@[[#name|link text]]@] within the same page, or%0a* [@PageName#name@] or [@[[PageName#name|link text]]@] for a location on another page%0a%0aThe form [@[[PageName(#name)]]@] may be useful for hiding the anchor text in a link. %0a%0a%0a!!Links to external sites ([=URLs=])%0a%0aLinks to external sites simply begin with a prefix such as 'http:', 'ftp:', etc.  Thus [@http://www.google.com/@] and [@[[http://www.google.com/]]@] both link to Google.  As with the above, an author can specify the link text by using the vertical brace or arrow syntax, as in [@[[http://www.google.com/ | Google]]@] and [@[[Google -> http://www.google.com]]@].%0a%0aInterMap links are also supported (see [[InterMap]]).  In particular, the [@Path:@] InterMap entry can be used to create links using relative or absolute paths on the current site (e.g., [@Path:../../somedir/foo.html@] or [@Path:/dir/something.gif@]).%0a%0a!!Links to pages in other [[wiki group]]s%0a%0aSee [[WikiGroup]].%0a%0a!!Links that open a new browser window%0a%0aTo have a link open in another window, use [@%25newwin%25@]:%0a%0a* [@%25newwin%25  http://www.pmichaud.com@] produces %25newwin%25  http://www.pmichaud.com %0a* [@%25newwin%25  Main.WikiSandbox@] produces %25newwin%25  [[Main.WikiSandbox]]%0a%0aYou can also specify that links should open in a new window via the @@target@@ attribute:%0a%0a(:markup:) [=%0a%25target=_blank%25 Any links on this line like http://www.pmichaud.com %0awill open in a new window.%0a=]%0a%0a%25trail%25%3c%3c|[[DocumentationIndex]]|>>
