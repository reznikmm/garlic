text=This page provides a more complete list of some of the markup sequences available in PmWiki.  Note that it's easy to create and edit pages without using any of the markups below, but if you ever need them, they're here. ²²To experiment with the rules, please try editing the [[Main/WikiSandbox]].²²----²!!!Paragraphs²²* Do not indent paragraphs²(:markup:)²--> Indentation by using "-->" - ok, if you want the entire paragraph indented, as with a block quote.²(:markupend:)² Indentation by using a blank space at the margin - not so good.²You get the monospaced font, and it ''won't'' line-wrap.  Instead, it will force the page to be as wide as the line is long.  In some skins, the text is placed inside of a box with dashed-line border.²²* Words wrap and fill as needed²* Use blank lines as separators²* Use [@\@] (single backslash) at the end of a line to join the current line to the next one.²* Use [@\\@] (two backslashes) at the end of a line to force a line break, but keep the current ''environment'' (e.g. stay inside the current list item).²* Use [@\\\@] (three backslashes) to force a line break and skip a line, keeping the current ''environment''. (Every additional backslash skips another line)²²----²!!!Indented Paragraphs ''(Quotes)''²²Arrows ([@->@]) at the beginning of a paragraph can be used to produce an indented paragraph.  More hyphens at the beginning ([@--->@]) produce larger indents.²²(:markup:)²->Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.²(:markupend:)²²Inverted Arrows ([@-<@])at the beginning of a paragraph can be used to produce a paragraph with a hanging indent.  Adding hyphens at the beginning ([@---<@]) causes all the text to indent.²²(:markup:)²-<Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. ²(:markupend:)²²(:markup:)²--<Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. ²(:markupend:)²----²!!! [[#BulletedLists]] Bulleted Lists²²Bullet lists are made by placing asterisks at the left margin.  More asterisks increases the level of bullet:²²(:markup:) ²* First-level list item²** Second-level list item²** Another second-level item²* A first-level item²(:markupend:)²²----²!!!Horizontal Line²²Four or more dashes ([=----=]) at the beginning of a line produce a horizontal line.²²----²!!!Emphasis²²* Enclose text in doubled single-quotes ([=''text''=]), i.e., ''two apostrophes'', for emphasis (usually ''italics'')²* Enclose text in tripled single-quotes ([='''text'''=]), i.e. ''three apostrophes'', for strong emphasis (usually '''bold''')²* Enclose text in five single-quotes ([='''''text'''''=]), or triples within doubles (''five apostrophes''), for some other kind of emphasis (usually '''''bold italics''''')²* Enclose text in doubled at-signs ([=@@text@@=]) for @@monospace@@ text²* Use [=[+large+]=] for [+large+] text, [=[++larger++]=] for [++larger++], [=[-small-]=] for [-small-] text, and [=[--smaller--]=] for [--smaller--].²* Emphasis can be used multiple times within a line, but cannot span across markup line boundaries (i.e., you can't put a paragraph break in the middle of bold text).²²Other styling ²(:markup:)²'+big+', '-small-', '^super^', '_sub_', ²²{+insert or underscore+}, ²²{-delete or strikethrough or strikeout-}²(:markupend:)²* [@`WikiWord@] `WikiWord neutralisation²²See also [[Wiki Styles]] for advanced text formatting options.²²----²!!!References²²* Use words and phrases in double brackets (e.g., [=[[text formatting rules]]=]) to create links to other pages on this wiki.²* On some PmWiki installations, capitalized words joined together (e.g., [[WikiWord]]s) can also be used to make references to other pages without needing the double-brackets.²* Precede [=URLs=] with "@@http:@@", "@@ftp:@@", "@@gopher:@@", "@@mailto:@@", or "@@news:@@" to create links automatically, as in http://www.pmichaud.com/toast.²* [=URLs=] ending with @@.gif@@, @@.jpg@@, or @@.png@@ are displayed as images in the page²* Links with arbitrary text can be created as either [=[[=]''target'' | ''text'']] or [=[[=]''text'' -> ''target''[=]]=].  ''Text'' can be an image URL, in which case the image becomes the link to the remote ''url'' or ''[[WikiWord]]''.²* [[#Anchors]] Anchor targets within pages (#-links) can be created using @@[=[[#target]]=]@@.²²----²!!!Headings²²Headings are made by placing an exclamation mark ('''!''') at the left margin.  More exclamation marks increase the level of heading.  For example,²²(:markup:)²! Level 1 Heading²!! Level 2 Heading²!!! Level 3 Heading²!!!! Level 4 Heading²(:markupend:)²²----²!!!Escape sequence²²Anything placed between [=[= and =]=] is not interpreted by [[PmWiki/PmWiki]].  This makes it possible to easily do [=WikiWords=] that are not links and turn off other special formatting interpretation.  The [=[= and =]=] can span multiple input lines, allowing effects to be applied to multiple input lines.  For example, space[[===] at the beginning of a line will cause the text up to the next =] to be monospace and uninterpreted by [[PmWiki/PmWiki]] (useful for program listings).²²----²!!!Numbered Lists²²Numbered lists are made by placing number-signs (#) at the left margin.²²(:markup:)²# Prepare the experiment²## Unwrap the pop-tart²## Insert the pop-tart into the toaster²# Begin cooking the pop tart²# Stand back²(:markupend:)²²----²!!! [[#DefinitionLists]] Definition Lists²²Definition lists are made by placing colons at the left margin:²²(:markup:)²:term:definition of term²::second-level item: definition of 2nd-level item²(:markupend:)²²----²(:include SpecialCharacters:)²----²!!!Tables²²Table are defined by enclosing cells with '||'.  A cell with leading and trailing spaces is centered; a cell with leading spaces is right-aligned; all other cells are left-aligned.  An empty cell will cause the previous cell to span multiple columns.  (There is currently no mechanism for spanning multiple rows.)  A line beginning with '||' specifies the table attributes for subsequent tables. A '!' as the first character in a cell provides emphasis that can be used to provide headings. This is interesting stuff.²²(:markup:)²²||border=1 width=50%²||!Table||!Heading||!Example||²||!Left   || Center || Right||²||A       ||!  a B   ||     C||²||        || single ||      ||²||        || multi span   ||||²(:markupend:)²²----²!!!Can't find it here?²See [[MarkupMasterIndex]], [[SimpleTables]], [[SimpleTables2]], [[AdvancedTables]], or [[Links]].²²%trail%<<|[[PmWiki.Documentation Index]]|>>
