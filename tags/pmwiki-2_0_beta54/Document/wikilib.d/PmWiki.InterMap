text=The [[InterMap]] is a system for defining links between [[WikiWikiWeb]] sites that was first developed by UseMod:UseModWiki and Meatball:MeatballWiki.  InterMap links have the form [@MapPrefix:Page@], where the host prefix is converted to a partial URL based on entries in the site's ''intermap.txt'' and ''localmap.txt'' files.께The default ''intermap.txt'' distributed with PmWiki includes the following InterMap entries:    [=    PmWiki          http://www.pmwiki.org/pmwiki2/pmwiki.php/    Cookbook        http://www.pmwiki.org/pmwiki2/pmwiki.php/Cookbook/    Wiki            http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?
