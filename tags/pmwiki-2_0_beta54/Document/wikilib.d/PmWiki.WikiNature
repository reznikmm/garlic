text=Mark Twain wrote that "continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection". Things change: a wiki, like most web sites, is ''always'' under construction.²²Over time, the contents become more authoritative and more useful to more people, as readers like you decide to become authors and contribute.²²You should always use independent sources to check facts. The open nature of the wiki means that published materials are not verified. You alone are responsible for any actions you may take based on this material.²
