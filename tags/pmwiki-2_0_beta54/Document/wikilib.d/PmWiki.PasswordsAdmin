text=PmWiki has built-in support for [[Passwords|password-protecting]] various areas of the wiki site.  Passwords can be applied to individual pages, to [[Wiki Group]]s, or to the entire wiki site.  Note that the password protection mechanisms described here are only a small part of overall system (and wiki) security, see [[PmWiki.Security]] for more discussion of this.께Authors can use PmWiki to add passwords to individual pages and WikiGroups as described in [[PmWiki.Passwords]].  However, [[WikiAdministrator]]s can also set passwords in [[local customization(s)]] files as described below.께PmWiki supports several levels of access to wiki pages:-> @@read@@ passwords allow viewing the contents of wiki pages-> @@edit@@ passwords control editing and modification of wiki pages-> @@attr@@ passwords control who is able to set passwords on pages (and potentially other future attributes)-> if uploads are enabled, @@upload@@ passwords control uploading of files and attachments께Finally, there is an @@admin@@ password that allows an administrator to override the passwords set for any individual page or group.께[[#page-attr]]Pages have their passwords as "page attributes" that are accessed by using ?action=attr at the end of a URL.  Group passwords are held in a special page called "GroupAttributes" for each group.  Global site-wide passwords are controlled by the $DefaultPasswords array.  All passwords are stored in an encrypted format so that other users on the system cannot simply browse the contents of files to determine the passwords.께By default, $DefaultPasswords is set with empty @@read@@, @@edit@@, and @@attr@@ passwords and locked @@admin@@ and @@upload@@ passwords.  In addition, as distributed, the [[Main.GroupAttributes]] and [[PmWiki.GroupAttributes]] have locked @@attr@@ passwords on them to prevent authors from setting passwords on pages in those groups.  (To change these passwords, use [[Main.GroupAttributes?action=attr]] or [[PmWiki.GroupAttributes?action=attr]].)께To set the site-wide admin password to "@@mysecret@@", an administrator can place the following line in ''config.php'':께    $DefaultPasswords['admin'] = crypt('mysecret');께(Note that the @@crypt('mysecret')@@ function is required for indirect, processed, assignment of the password. Since all passwords are stored as encrypted strings, the direct assignment @@..['admin]='mysecret'@@ would be interpreted as an encryption of something else.)께Of course, as written here anyone able to view ''config.php'' would immediately know the site's password, so some sites would like it to be encrypted in the ''config.php'' file as well.  Add @@?action=crypt@@ to the end of any PmWiki URL (or jump to [[{$Name}?action=crypt]]) and you'll be presented with a form to give you the encrypted form of the password.  For example, when the ''crypt'' action is given the password "@@mysecret@@", PmWiki gives back a string like께    [=$1$hMMhCdfT$mZSCh.BJOidMRn4SOUUSi1=]께(it may be different on your system).  This string can then be put directly into ''config.php'' as:    [=    $DefaultPasswords['admin'] = '$1$hMMhCdfT$mZSCh.BJOidMRn4SOUUSi1';      =]께Note that in the encrypted form the ''crypt'' keyword and parentheses are removed, since the password is already encrypted.  Also, the encrypted password must be in single quotes.  In this example the password is still "@@mysecret@@", but somebody looking at ''config.php'' won't be able to see that just from looking at the encrypted form.  ''Crypt'' may give you different encryptions for the same password--this is normal (and makes it harder for someone else to determine the original password).께Similarly, you can set [@$DefaultPasswords['read']@], [@$DefaultPasswords['edit']@], and [@$DefaultPasswords['attr']@] to control default @@read@@, @@edit@@, and @@attr@@ passwords for the entire site.  The default passwords are used only for pages and groups which do not have passwords set.  Also, each of the $DefaultPasswords values may be arrays of encrypted passwords.께To remove a site password entirely, such as the default locked password for uploads, just set it to empty:께    $DefaultPasswords['upload'] = '';께In PmWiki, page passwords override group passwords, group passwords override the default passwords, and the admin password always allows access.  This gives a great deal of flexibility in controlling access to wiki pages in PmWiki.  께You can also use the special password "nopass" (defined by the $AllowPassword variable) via @@?action=attr@@ to have a non-password protected page within a password-protected group, or a non-password protected group with a site-wide default password set.께To use PmWiki itself to set passwords on individual wiki pages and Wiki Groups via @@?action=attr@@, see [[PmWiki.Passwords]].께Category: [[!Passwords]]께%trail%<<|[[DocumentationIndex]]|>>
