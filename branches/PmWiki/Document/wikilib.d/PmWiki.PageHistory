Clicking the link will open an edit box with the page as it was ''before'' that edit.  You can make changes or simply click Save to restore the text.%0a%0aThere are two additional options specific to Page''''History:%0a* '''Hide minor edits''' - hides any edit that the author marked as 'minor'.%0a* '''Show changes to markup'''- shows changes to the markup (as opposed to the normal display which shows changes to the output).%0a%0aA page's history is kept for the number of days given by the $DiffKeepDays variable (set by the site's [[wiki administrator]]).
