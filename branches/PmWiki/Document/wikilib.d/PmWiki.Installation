text=(:title PmWiki Installation :)%0a%25audience%25 administrators (basic)%0aThis page explains how to download and install PmWiki 2.0.  Here's a list of related pages:%0a%0a* [[Requirements]] - Requirements for installing PmWiki.%0a* [[Upgrades]] - How to upgrade an existing installation.%0a* [[WikiFarms]] - Running multiple wikis from a single installation.%0a* [[ChangeLog]] - New features and bug fixes that are available.%0a%0aImprovements to these instructions would be greatly appreciated.  Just report any problems you  encounter to the pmwiki-users [[mailing list(s)]] or use the [[PITS:PITS |PmWiki Issue Tracking System]].%0a%0a!! Installing PmWiki%0a%0a1. Download the latest version of PmWiki as a zip archive ([[(http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/)pmwiki-latest.zip]]) or a gzipped tarball ([[(http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/)pmwiki-latest.tgz]]) from [[http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/]].%0a%0a2. Unpack the archive ([@tar zxvf pmwiki-latest.tgz@] or [@unzip pmwiki-latest.zip@]).  This will create a ''pmwiki-x.y.z'' directory containing the PmWiki software.  For example, the current "latest" should unpack to a directory named "[-{$Version}-]".  The files in this directory include:%0a%0a    COPYING            The GNU General Public License%0a    local/             A directory for local configuration scripts%0a    pmwiki.php         Main PmWiki script%0a    pub/               Directory of publicly accessible files%0a      css/             Directory for generic .css files%0a      skins/           Directory of layout templates ([[skins]])%0a    sample-config.php  A sample configuration file%0a    scripts/           Some scripts that extend the possibilities of PmWiki%0a    wikilib.d/         Directory containing some default PmWiki files%0a    cookbook/          A directory for recipes obtained from the [[(Cookbook:)Cookbook]].%0a%0a3. The ''pmwiki-x.y.z'' directory needs to be placed into a location accessible by your webserver (e.g., in a ''public_html'' directory of some sort).  You can place files and directories using a number of methods -- FTP, or a Unix [@mv@] or [@cp@] command generally does the job.%0a%0a->%25note%25 Note: It's probably also a good idea to change the "''pmwiki-x.y.z''" directory name to be simply "''pmwiki''".%0a%0a4. Open a web browser to the ''pmwiki.php'' script on the server (i.e., not the one on your local computer or accessed using a [=file://...=] URL).  PmWiki will then analyze your system configuration and provide instructions (if needed) for creating the ''wiki.d/'' directory which will be used to hold the pages created for your site.  Usually there are two ways to achieve this:%0a%0a->4a. You can create the ''wiki.d/'' directory manually, and then give it full write permissions (i.e., "[@chmod 777 wiki.d@]"). Use this method when "safe mode" is activated in the servers PHP installation.%0a%0a->4b. On some systems you can let PmWiki create ''wiki.d/'' by temporarily changing the permissions on the directory containing the ''pmwiki.php'' file to 2777.  In Unix this is commonly done by changing to the directory containing ''pmwiki.php'' and executing the command%0a%0a        chmod 2777 .%0a%0a->(note the dot at the end). The [@chmod@] command also works in many FTP programs. Creating ''wiki.d/'' in this manner will (1) make the directory writable so the web server can create the data directory it needs for the wiki files, (2) preserve group ownership of the directory so the installer account can manipulate the files created in this directory, and (3) make it more difficult for other accounts on the same server to access the files in ''wiki.d/''.%0a%0a5.  After establishing directory permissions, try opening a browser to the ''pmwiki.php'' script again.  If all is well, the ''wiki.d'' directory will have been created and you'll see the default home page.%0a%0aImportant: If you used method 4b, you should reset permissions by executing "[@chmod 755 .@]" in the directory containing pmwiki.php.%0a%0a6.  Check out [[Initial Setup Tasks]] for other tasks you may want to perform to begin customizing your PmWiki installation.  You might also want to peruse the [[Release Notes]] for further information.%0a%0a7.  If you want to use PmWiki in a different language download the international language pack as zip archive ([[(http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/)i18n.zip]]) or as gzipped tarball ([[(http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/)i18n.tgz]]) from [[http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/]]. Then extract it and copy the files into the ''wikilib.d/'' directory as described above%0a%0a!!Notes%0a%0a* If using the Unix ''tar'' command to unpack the archive in step 2 above, be sure that the files are created with sufficient permissions for the webserver to be able to access them.  Usually you can ensure this by typing @@umask 002@@ on the command line before unpacking the tar file.%0a%0a* Many admins add an ''index.php'' file in the pmwiki directory that contains the following single line:%0a%0a-->[@%3c?php include('pmwiki.php');@]%0a%0a->%25note%25 Note that the PHP closing tag "[@ ?>@]" is omitted on purpose to be compatible with some operating systems that are confused by extra newlines.%0a%0a* When installing on windows you should take a look at [[Cookbook:SimuleditWithoutPopen]]. Because on windows the default handling of simultaneous edits is not possible, the necessary command @@diff3@@ simply does not exist on windows systems.%0a%0a%25trail%25%3c%3c|[DocumentationIndex|>>
