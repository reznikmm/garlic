Introduction: Ada 95 & Distributed Systems.
-------------------------------------------

Ada 95 is the first general-purpose language to provide a standard
distributed programming paradigm. By combining the distributed and
object-oriented features of Ada 95, it is possible to create an
application where objects are physically distributed over a network of
machines, without having to interface to any low-level communication
layer.  Likewise, by combining the distributed and real-time
capabilities of Ada 95, it is possible to design applications which
meet real-time constraints in a distributed environment.

GLADE is an implementation of the Distributed Systems Annex for the
GNAT compiler. GLADE stands for GNAT Library for Ada Distributed
Execution. It is an complete environment for developping distributed
applications that includes: 

- a complete PCS (Partition Communication System)
- a simple partition description language & tool
- utilities to build and start distributed applications

The caller and receiver stubs needed by the PCS are generated by the
GNAT compiler using special flags. The partitioning tool is
responsible for calling GNAT with the appropriate flags.

Installation, Documentation & Examples.
---------------------------------------

To see how to install the system please read file
[install_guide.md](Doc/install_guide.md)
in Doc directory. Please look under the "Doc" directory for
[documentation](Doc/glade_ug.md) on
how to use GLADE and some more hints on installation possibilities.
Directory "Examples" contains some examples on how to program a
distributed application in Ada 95.

If you have a problem making your partitions connect with each other,
please check that:

  - You can use `rsh` from any machine involved in the distributed
    application to any other.

  - Your `/etc/hosts` file (on Unix systems) does not associate your
    machine name with the 127.0.0.1 address; be aware that some systems
    come misconfigured by default.

What does it run on.
--------------------

This release is fully supported on:
  - PC/Linux
  - Windows NT

It may work on other platforms too.

Downloading GLADE.
------------------

We don't provide binary distribution for now.

Bug Reports & Technical Questions.
