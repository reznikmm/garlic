text=%3c%3c|[[PmWiki.Variables]]|>>%0a%0a:$EnableFixedUrlRedirect:When PmWiki is given a partial page name (e.g., just the name of a WikiGroup), it uses $PagePathFmt in order to make a complete page name from the partial one, then issues a "redirect" to the browser to tell it to reload the page with the correct full page name.  Setting $EnableFixedUrlRedirect=0; blocks the redirect, so that PmWiki continues processing with the adjusted page name rather than issuing the redirect. %0a%0a:$EnableIMSCaching:A variable which, when set equal to 1, recognizes the "If-Modified-Since" header coming from browsers and allows browsers to use locally cached pages.  Disabled by default to help the administrator customize its page without needing permanent reloading.%0a%0a:$EnableStopWatch:This activates an internal stopwatch that shows how long it takes to render a page. (If you have a wiki that composes a HTML page from multiple pages, such as a normal layout with a sidebar, you'll get separate timings for each subpage and for the total page.)%0a%0a: :The timings can be displayed by adding [@%3c!--function:StopWatch-->@] in the wiki template.%0a%0a: :Valid values are:%0a        $EnableStopWatch = 0; # No timings (the default). No HTML will be generated.%0a        $EnableStopWatch = 1; # Wall-clock timings only.%0a        $EnableStopWatch = 2; # Wall-clock and CPU usage timings. Won't work on Windows.%0a%0a:$FmtV: %0a: :This variable is an array that is used for string substitutions at the end of a call to [@FmtPageName()@]. For each element in the array, the "key" (interpreted as a string) will be replaced by the corresponding "value".  The variable is intended to be a place to store substitution variables that have frequently changing values (thus avoiding a rebuild of the variable cache).  Also see $FmtP.%0a%0a:$FmtP:%0a: :This variable is an array that is used for pattern substitutions near the beginning of a call to [@FmtPageName@]. For each element in the array, the "key" (interpreted as a pattern) will be replaced by the corresponding value evaluated for the name of the current page. This is for instance used to handle $-substitutions that depend on the pagename passed to [@FmtPageName()@].  Also see $FmtV.%0a%0a:$FmtPV:%0a: :This variable is an array that is used for [[Page Variables]]. New variables can be defined with [@$FmtPV['$VarName'] = 'variable definition';@]  which can be used in markup with [@{$VarName}@]. %0a%0a:$HandleAuth:This sets the required authentication Level that is necessary to perform an action. When using the following example in your @@config.php@@ you need to be authenticated as editor in order to view the page history:%0a        $HandleAuth['diff'] = 'edit';%0a%0a:$HTMLVSpace:Setting [@$HTMLVSpace = '';@] in a local customizationfile (e.g., [@local/config.php@]) prevents insertion of spacer paragraphs ([@%3cp class='vspace'>%3c/p>@]) in generated HTML code. To limit this change to a single skin, place the [@$HTMLVSpace = '';@] statement in a skin.php file, preceded by the statement [@global $HTMLVSpace;@].%0a%0a:$MetaRobots:Sets the value of the [@%3cmeta name='robots' ... />@] tag generated by PmWiki to control search engine robots accessing the site.  PmWiki's default setting tells robots to not index anything but the normal page view, and to not index pages in the PmWiki [[wiki group]].  Explicitly setting $MetaRobots overrides this default.%0a        # never index this site%0a        $MetaRobots = 'noindex,nofollow';%0a        # disable the robots tag entirely%0a        $MetaRobots = '';%0a%0a:$TableCellAttrFmt:For [[Tables]], defines the HTML attributes given to each @@%3ctd>@@ or @@%3cth>@@ cell in the output.  Can contain references to $TableCellCount which holds the horizontal column number of the current cell.%0a%0a:$TableRowAttrFmt:For [[Tables]], defines the HTML attributes given to each @@%3ctr>@@ element in the output.  Can contain references to $TableRowCount to give the absolute row number within the table, or $TableRowIndex to provide a repeating row index from 1 to $TableRowIndexMax.%0a        # Give each row a unique CSS class based on row number (tr1, tr2, tr3, ... )%0a        $TableRowAttrFmt = "class='tr\$TableRowCount'";%0a        # Give each row alternating CSS classes (ti1, ti2, ti1, ti2, ti1, ... )%0a        $TableRowIndexMax = 2;%0a        $TableRowAttrFmt = "class='ti\$TableRowIndex'";%0a%0a:$TableRowIndexMax:The maximum value for $TableRowIndex in [[Tables]].%0a        # Set rows indexes as 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, ...%0a        $TableRowIndexMax = 3;%0a %0a:$WorkDir:%0a: :This variable is a string that gives a local path to a directory where the pmwiki engine can create temporary files etc. PmWiki needs this for a variety of things, such as building merged edits, caching mailposts entries, keeping track of the last modification time of the site, other types of cache, etc.  Do not confuse this variable with $WikiDir; the reason that both $WorkDir and $WikiDir refer by default to the directory [@wiki.d/@] is merely to simplify things for the administrator. %0a%0a:$WikiDir: %0a: :$WikiDir is a `PageStore-object that refers to how wiki pages are stored. This can be a simple reference to a directory (typically [@wiki.d@]), or something more advanced such as a [=MySQL=] backend or a .dbm-file.  Do not confuse this variable with $WorkDir; the reason that both $WorkDir and $WikiDir refer by default to the directory [@wiki.d/@] is merely to simplify things for the administrator.%0a%0a:$PageAttributes:Set the string showed on the attributes page when entering a password for an action.%0a        #example for "source" action%0a        [=$PageAttributes['passwdsource'] = "$['Set new source password']"=]%0a
