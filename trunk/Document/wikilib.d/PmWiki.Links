text=A key feature of [[WikiWikiWeb]]s is the ease of creating links to other places in the text of the document.  PmWiki provides multiple mechanisms for creating such links.께!!!Links to other pages께First, to create a link to another page, simply enclose the name of the page inside double brackets, as in [@[[wiki sandbox]]@] or [@[[installation]]@].  These result in links to [[wiki sandbox]] and [[installation]], respectively.께PmWiki ignores all spaces between words when creating a link from the text inside the double brackets, and will automatically capitalize words following spaces and other punctuation (like ~). Thus [@[[Wiki sandbox]]@], [@[[wiki sandbox]]@], and [@[[WikiSandbox]]@] all display differently but link to the same page - which is titled ''`WikiSandbox''.께In other words, when a page is created PmWiki will automatically create a [[PmWiki/WikiWord]] for its title, but links to the page will display as written.께A suffix can also be added to the end of a link, which becomes part of the link text but not the target.  Thus [@[[wiki sandbox]]es@] is still a link to WikiSandbox but displays as [[wiki sandbox]]es.  And you can put parentheses around any text you don't want to have displayed, so that [@[[(wiki) sandbox]]@] still links to WikiSandbox but displays as [[(wiki) sandbox]].께Finally, you can specify the link text via a vertical brace, thus  [@[[WikiSandbox |a play area]]@], which links to WikiSandbox but displays as [[WikiSandbox |a play area]].  Alternately, you can use an arrow ([@->@]) to reverse the order of the text and target, as in [@[[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]@]  ([[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]).께Some sites also recognize WikiWord links, in which a WikiWord appearing in the text is automatically treated as a link to a page of the same name.께!!!Links to external sites ([=URLs=])께Links to external sites simply begin with a prefix such as 'http:', 'ftp:', etc.  Thus [@http://www.google.com/@] and [@[[http://www.google.com/]]@] both link to Google.  As with the above, an author can specify the link text by using the vertical brace or arrow syntax, as in [@[[http://www.google.com/ | Google]]@] and [@[[Google -> http://www.google.com]]@].께InterMap links are also supported (see [[InterMap]]).께!!!Links to specific locations within a page께To define a location within a page to which you may jump directly, use the markup [@[[#name]]@].   This will create an "anchor" that uniquely identifies that location in the page.  Then to have a link jump directly to that anchor, use one of께* [@[[#name|link text]]@] within the same page, or* [@PageName#name@] or [@[[PageName#name|link text]]@] for a location on another page께You may find the form [@[[PageName(#name)]]@] more useful than [@[[Pagename#name]]@] as the former hides the anchor text while the latter displays it. 께!!!Links that open a new browser window께These are particularly useful for links to external sites where you want to keep the window to your Wiki open, allowing users to return to your site easily.* [@%newwin%  http://www.pmichaud.com@] produces this link: %newwin%  http://www.pmichaud.com * [@%newwin%  Main.WikiSandbox@] produces this link: %newwin%  Main.WikiSandbox께You can also specify that links should open in a new window via the @@target@@ attribute:께    [=%target=_blank% Any links on this line like http://www.pmichaud.com     will open in a new window. =]께which gives께->%target=_blank% Any links on this line like http://www.pmichaud.com will open in a new window.께(This method is described in WikiStyles).   께%trail%<<|DocumentationIndex|>>
